# OpenThings
Things for OpenComputers. Not much else to say.

Current "roadmap":

- [ ] Extra adapter integration with... something.
- [ ] Storage Adapter (computer controlled item transfer via OC cables/components)
- [ ] Tier 4 case/memory (Long term, do not expect to be finished ever)
- [ ] Zilog Z80 architecture (Long term, do not expect to be finished ever)
